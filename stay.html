            <p class="content">The Safari Collection manages a portfolio of Kenya luxury safari lodges and boutique camps in East Africa. By choosing to stay at one (or more) of our properties, you can explore the diverse landscape and culture that Kenya has to offer. From the historical grounds of Giraffe Manor in Nairobi to the Maasai culture and density of wildlife at Sala’s Camp in the Mara, and from the rugged landscape and views of Mount Kenya at Solio Lodge to breath-taking panoramas across the arid land at Sasaab in Samburu, each lodge has a unique environment and distinct features. We also have our own exclusive mobile camp called Siruai located in north west Laikipia. We can also arrange stays with our partner properties elsewhere in the region as part of a bespoke Kenya safari itinerary.</p>
